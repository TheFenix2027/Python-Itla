File handling is an important part of any web application.
Python has several functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting files.
The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.
To open a file for reading it is enough to specify the name of the file
Note: Make sure the file exists, or else you will get an error.
